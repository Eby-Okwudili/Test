# To improve you need to:
- well organised files
- good use of font awesome!
- good commenting
- good use of semantic tags 
- remember this site is for employment as a developer, not personal ( though I can see you like expressing yourself!)
- use material design system and colour!
- where is the portfolio page?
- two colours only, this includes all values/light and dark, plus black/white and all values of grey
- use modern fonts- avoid script fonts (even if you like them) 
- follow existing models of good practice for modern portfolios/ refer to collections and models used in class and on material design site.
- Fix contrast in navigation, make accessible and readable.
- There are issues around padding and margins--everywhere!
- Read the marking rubric CAREFULLY!
